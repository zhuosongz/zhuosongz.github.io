  abstract = {We establish Cramér-type moderate deviation theorems for the sums of locally dependent random variables and combinatorial central limit theorems. Optimal error bounds and convergence ranges are obtained under some mild exponential moment conditions. Our main results are more general or sharper than the results in the literature. The main results follow from a more general Cramér-type moderate deviation theorem for dependent random variables without any boundedness assumptions, which is of independent interest. The proofs couple Stein’s method with a recursive argument.},

  abstract = {A Cramér-type moderate deviation theorem quantifies the relative error of the tail probability approximation. It provides a criterion whether the limiting tail probability can be used to estimate the tail probability under study. Chen, Fang and Shao (2013) obtained a general Cramér-type moderate result using Stein’s method when the limiting was a normal distribution. In this paper, Cramér-type moderate deviation theorems are established for nonnormal approximation under a general Stein identity, which is satisfied via the exchangeable pair approach and Stein’s coupling. In particular, a Cramér-type moderate deviation theorem is obtained for the general Curie–Weiss model and the imitative monomer-dimer mean-field model.},

  abstract = {An exchangeable pair approach is commonly taken in the normal and nonnormal approximation using Stein’s method. It has been successfully used to identify the limiting distribution and provide an error of approximation. However, when the difference of the exchangeable pair is not bounded by a small deterministic constant, the error bound is often not optimal. In this paper, using the exchangeable pair approach of Stein’s method, a new Berry–Esseen bound for an arbitrary random variable is established without a bound on the difference of the exchangeable pair. An optimal convergence rate for normal and nonnormal approximation is achieved when the result is applied to various examples including the quadratic forms, general Curie–Weiss model, mean field Heisenberg model and colored graph model.},
